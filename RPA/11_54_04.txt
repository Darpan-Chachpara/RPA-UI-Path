 Date and Time Variables
SUGGEST EDITS
The date and time variable is a type of variable that enables you to store information about any date and time. This type of variable can be found in the Browse and Select a .Net Type window, under the System namespace System.DateTime. For more information, see Browsing for .Net Variable Types.

For example, they can be used to append dates to invoices or any other documents you may be working with and are time-sensitive.

Example of Using a Date and Time Variable
To exemplify how you can work with a date and time variable, we are going to build an automation that gets the current date and time, subtracts a specific amount of time and writes the result to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.

Create a new sequence.
Create two DateTime variables, Today and LastTime.
Create a TimeSpan variable, called Span, and in the Default field type 1.02:10:04.
Note:
The default value attributed to theSpan variable uses the day.hh:mm:ss format.

Add an Assign activity to the Designer panel.
In the Properties panel, in the To field, add the Today variable.
In the Value field, type Now. This gives you the date and time when the project is executed, in the dd/MM/yyyy and hh:mm:ss formats.
Add another Assign activity under the previous one.
In the Properties panel, in the To field, add the LastTime variable.
In the Value field, type Today.Subtract(Span). This is going to subtract the default value of the Span variable from the current date and time, stored in the Today variable.
Add an Excel Application Scope activity under the last Assign one.
